app/tools/ai_helpers.py

Shared helpers for the "modern AI" upgrades to app/tools/tasks.py.

These wrap third-party AI services (Whisper, Replicate, ElevenLabs) behind
small functions with consistent signatures and graceful fallbacks, so the
Celery tasks stay readable and every external call can fail without
crashing a job.

New dependencies (add to requirements.txt):
    openai-whisper            # or faster-whisper for CPU speed
    replicate                 # Replicate API client
    ffmpeg-python             # thin wrapper around the ffmpeg binary

New environment variables:
    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN       # enables Replicate-backed features:
                              #   - background removal (fallback for rembg)
                              #   - Real-ESRGAN video/image upscaling
